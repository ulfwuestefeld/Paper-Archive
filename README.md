# Paper-Archive
A tiny and responsive Wordpress Plugin to show generated Thumbnails of PDFs in 3 columns and link to the respective PDFs.

Simply attach the PDFs to the desired page or article in the media library and then use the shortcode [paperarchive] in the page or article. Now the PDFs are displayed with the generated thumbnail in the post or page.

Clicking on the thumbnail opens the PDF in a new window.
